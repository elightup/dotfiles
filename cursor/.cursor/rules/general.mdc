- **Readability first**:
  Write small, single-purpose functions and components. Prefer declarative code.
  Add comments for *why* (not *what*).

- **Use descriptive names**:
  Names should communicate purpose and be consistent across languages.
  Use meaningful names that describe intent (e.g. `useFetchPosts`, `ConfirmDeleteButton`, `sanitize_user_input`).
  Avoid abbreviations unless widely recognized.

- **Keep changes small and incremental**:
  Prefer minimal, focused commits and safe refactors.
  Always add/update tests when making changes.
